            I'm a passionate Cloud Infrastructure Consultant and Linux System Administrator with a deep drive for technology innovation and automation. Currently working at Accenture, I specialize in designing, deploying, and maintaining cloud-based infrastructures that power businesses across various industries. My role involves ensuring high availability, scalability, and security for cloud environments, all while optimizing performance and reducing operational costs.

            With a strong background in Linux systems, I’ve honed my skills in managing complex server environments and troubleshooting technical issues. My hands-on experience spans across mainly the cloud platform AWS, where I implement cutting-edge solutions tailored to clients' needs.

            But I'm not stopping there. I’m actively transitioning into a DevOps-focused career, integrating continuous integration, delivery, and deployment practices into everything I do. Automation is at the core of my approach—I'm constantly exploring ways to streamline development pipelines and improve collaboration between teams, empowering faster delivery of high-quality software.
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe that the future of IT lies in the intersection of cloud infrastructure and DevOps, and I’m excited to be at the forefront of this transformation. Whether you're looking to optimize your current cloud environment, automate your operations, or implement best-in-class DevOps practices, I can help.
