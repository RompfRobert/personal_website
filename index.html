                        I'm a passionate Cloud Infrastructure Consultant and Linux System Administrator with a deep drive for technology innovation and automation. Currently working at Accenture, I specialize in designing, deploying, and maintaining cloud-based infrastructures that power businesses across various industries. My role involves ensuring high availability, scalability, and security for cloud environments, all while optimizing performance and reducing operational costs.
                    </p>
                    <p class="outline">
                        With a strong background in Linux systems, Iâ€™ve honed my skills in managing complex server environments and troubleshooting technical issues. My hands-on experience spans across mainly the cloud platform AWS, where I implement cutting-edge solutions tailored to clients' needs.
                    </p>
                    <p class="outline">
                        But I'm not stopping there. Iâ€™m actively transitioning into a DevOps-focused career, integrating continuous integration, delivery, and deployment practices into everything I do. Automation is at the core of my approachâ€”I'm constantly exploring ways to streamline development pipelines and improve collaboration between teams, empowering faster delivery of high-quality software.
                    </p>
                    <p class="outline">
                        I believe that the future of IT lies in the intersection of cloud infrastructure and DevOps, and Iâ€™m excited to be at the forefront of this transformation. Whether you're looking to optimize your current cloud environment, automate your operations, or implement best-in-class DevOps practices, I can help.
